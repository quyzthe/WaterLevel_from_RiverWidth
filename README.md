# Water Level Prediction from River Width 🌊📏

🛰️ Utilizing satellite images to retrieve hydrology factors is an efficient approach. In this project, we employ machine learning techniques to calculate water levels from river width data.

📁 In the accompanying .ipynb file, you will find an approach to deploy various machine learning models, including clustering and regression, to predict water levels based on river width. The dataset used for this analysis consists of river cross-section data from the Thanh My station on the Vu Gia Thu Bon river.

🚀 This marks my debut in the world of machine learning projects, and I'm excited to share my journey with you! You can find the code and more details about the project on my GitHub repository.
